## PlantPal Live Demo

The PlantPal application is live and can be accessed at [PlantPal Demo](https://www.plantpalhome.com/). This application integrates seamlessly with the PlantPal back-end, offering an intuitive experience for managing your plants remotely.

### Test User Credentials

You can explore the full functionality of the PlantPal application using the following demo account:

- **Email:** support@plantpalhome.com
- **Password:** testpassword123

Please note that this test account is connected to an actual PlantPal device in my kitchen, so any interactions may affect its operation. Feel free to explore, but please be considerate of its usage!

## Front-End: [PlantPal Front-End](https://github.com/AdenWhitworth/PlantPal_Front-End)

The web-based user interface for the PlantPal application, built with React and designed for seamless user experience.

## Back-End: [PlantPal Back-End](https://github.com/AdenWhitworth/plantpal_server)

The Node.js backend API and serverless AWS Lambda Functions for managing plant data, user authentication, and real-time device communication.

## Hardware: [PlantPal Hardware](https://github.com/AdenWhitworth/PlantPal_hardware)

The hardware repository containing the code and configuration for the IoT devices used in the PlantPal project.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: A powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, enabling the development of dynamic and responsive web applications.
- **TypeScript**: A strongly typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and provides better tooling and type safety during development.
- **HTML/JSX**: The foundational markup language used for structuring the components of the React application, ensuring semantic and accessible content.
- **Web Bluetooth**: A JavaScript library that enables communication with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) devices directly from the web, enhancing the application's connectivity features.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client that simplifies making API requests and handling responses, making it easier to interact with back-end services.
- **CSS**: Styles the application with a modern aesthetic, allowing for flexible and maintainable design.
